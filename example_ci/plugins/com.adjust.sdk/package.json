In there you can check how to integrate the Adjust SDK into your app. The example app has been uploaded without platforms being added due to size considerations, so after downloading the app, please run appropriate script from `scripts` folder to build the app for desired platform:\n\n```\nsh cordova-test-ios.sh\nsh cordova-test-android.sh\n```\n\n**Note**: Please have in mind that after building the example app for the first time for iOS platform, you will get the code signing error which requires you to open your app's Xcode project and choose your `Team` in `Signing` part of your Xcode project settings. After that, either run your app from Xcode or re-run the build script.\n\n## <a id=\"basic-integration\">Basic integration\n\nThese are the minimal steps required to integrate the Adjust SDK into your Cordova project.\n\n### <a id=\"sdk-get\">Get the SDK\n\nYou can get the latest version of the Adjust SDK from the `npm` [repository][npm-repo] or download the it from our [releases page][releases].\n\n### <a id=\"sdk-add\">Add the SDK to your project\n\nYou can download our SDK directly as the plugin from `npm` repository. In order to do that, just execute this command in your project folder:\n\n```\n> cordova plugin add com.adjust.sdk\nFetching plugin \"com.adjust.sdk\" via npm\nInstalling \"com.adjust.sdk\" for android\nInstalling \"com.adjust.sdk\" for ios\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you have downloaded our SDK from the releases page, extract the archive to the folder of your choice and execute the following command in your project folder:\n\n```\n> cordova plugin add path_to_folder/cordova_sdk\nInstalling \"com.adjust.sdk\" for android\nInstalling \"com.adjust.sdk\" for ios\n```\n\n<a id=\"sdk-cocoon\">**Note:** Starting from **Adjust SDK v4.11.1**, `npm` plugin and `master` branch are compatible with `cocoon.io`. There is no need to use SDK from `cocoon` branch anymore.\n\n### <a id=\"sdk-integrate\">Integrate the SDK into your app\n\nThe Adjust SDK automatically registers with the Cordova events `deviceready`, `resume` and `pause`.\n\nIn your `index.js` file after you have received the `deviceready` event, add the following code to initialize the Adjust SDK:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(\"{YourAppToken}\", AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox);\n\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nReplace `{YourAppToken}` with your app token. You can find this in your [dashboard].\n\nDepending on whether you build your app for testing or for production, you must set `environment` with one of these values:\n\n```javascript\nAdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox\nAdjustConfig.EnvironmentProduction\n```\n\n**Important:** This value should be set to `AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox` if and only if you or someone else is testing your app. Make sure to set the environment to `AdjustConfig.EnvironmentProduction` just before you publish the app. Set it back to `AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox` when you start developing and testing it again.\n\nWe use this environment to distinguish between real traffic and test traffic from test devices. It is very important that you keep this value meaningful at all times! This is especially important if you are tracking revenue.\n\n### <a id=\"sdk-logging\">Adjust logging\n\nYou can increase or decrease the amount of logs you see in tests by calling `setLogLevel` on your `AdjustConfig` instance with one of the following parameters:\n\n```js\nadjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelVerbose);   // enable all logging\nadjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelDebug);     // enable more logging\nadjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelInfo);      // the default\nadjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelWarn);      // disable info logging\nadjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelError);     // disable warnings as well\nadjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelAssert);    // disable errors as well\nadjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelSuppress);  // disable all logging\n```\n\n### <a id=\"adjust-project-settings\">Adjust project settings\n\nOnce the Adjust SDK has been added to your app, certain tweeks are being performed so that the Adjust SDK can work properly. Everything that is being done in this process is written in the `plugin.xml` file of the Adjust SDK plugin. Below you can find a description of every additional thing that the Adjust SDK performs after you've added it to your app.\n\n### <a id=\"android-permissions\">Android permissions\n\nThe Adjust SDK adds two permissions to your Android manifest file: `INTERNET` and `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE`. You can find this setting in the `plugin.xml` file of the Adjust SDK plugin:\n\n```xml\n<config-file target=\"AndroidManifest.xml\" parent=\"/manifest\">\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE\" />\n</config-file>\n```\n\n`INTERNET` permission is the permission that our SDK might need at any point in time. `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE` is the permission which the Adjust SDK needs in case your app is not targetting the Google Play Store and doesn't use Google Play Services. If you are targetting the Google Play Store and you are using Google Play Services, the Adjust SDK doesn't need this permission and, if you don't need it anywhere else in your app, you can remove it.\n\n### <a id=\"android-gps\">Google Play Services\n\nSince the August 1, 2014, apps in the Google Play Store must use the [Google Advertising ID][google-ad-id] to uniquely identify each device. To allow the Adjust SDK to use the Google Advertising ID, you must integrate [Google Play Services][google-play-services].\n\nThe Adjust SDK adds Google Play Services by default to your app. This is done with this line in the `plugin.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<framework src=\"com.google.android.gms:play-services-analytics:+\" />\n```\n\nIf you are using other Cordova plugins, they might also be importing Google Play Services by default into your app. If this is the case, Google Play Services from our SDK and other plugins can conflict and cause build time errors. Google Play Services does not have to be present in your app as part of our SDK exclusively. As long as you have the **analytics part of the Google Play Services library integrated in your app**, our SDK will be able to read all the necessary information. In case you choose to add Google Play Services into your app as part of another Cordova plugin, you can simply remove the above line from the `plugin.xml` file of our SDK.\n\nTo check whether the analytics part of the Google Play Services library has been successfully added to your app so that the Adjust SDK can read it properly, you should start your app by configuring the SDK to run in `sandbox` mode and set the log level to `verbose`. After that, track a session or some events in your app and observe the list of parameters in the verbose logs which are being read once the session or event has been tracked. If you see a parameter called `gps_adid` in there, you have successfully added the analytics part of the Google Play Services library to your app and our SDK is reading the necessary information from it.\n\n### <a id=\"android-proguard\">Proguard settings\n\nIf you are using Proguard, add these lines to your Proguard file:\n\n```\n-keep public class com.adjust.sdk.** { *; }\n-keep class com.google.android.gms.common.ConnectionResult {\n    int SUCCESS;\n}\n-keep class com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.AdvertisingIdClient {\n    com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.AdvertisingIdClient$Info getAdvertisingIdInfo(android.content.Context);\n}\n-keep class com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.AdvertisingIdClient$Info {\n    java.lang.String getId();\n    boolean isLimitAdTrackingEnabled();\n}\n-keep class dalvik.system.VMRuntime {\n    java.lang.String getRuntime();\n}\n-keep class android.os.Build {\n    java.lang.String[] SUPPORTED_ABIS;\n    java.lang.String CPU_ABI;\n}\n-keep class android.content.res.Configuration {\n    android.os.LocaledList getLocales();\n    java.util.Locale locale;\n}\n-keep class android.os.LocaledList {\n    java.util.Locale get(int);\n}\n```\n\n### <a id=\"android-broadcast-receiver\">Android install referrer\n\nThe Adjust install referrer broadcast receiver is added to your app by default. For more information, you can check our native [Android SDK README][broadcast-receiver]. You can find this setting in the `plugin.xml` file of the the Adjust SDK plugin:\n\n```xml\n<config-file target=\"AndroidManifest.xml\" parent=\"/manifest/application\">\n    <receiver\n        android:name=\"com.adjust.sdk.AdjustReferrerReceiver\"\n        android:exported=\"true\">\n        <intent-filter>\n            <action android:name=\"com.android.vending.INSTALL_REFERRER\" />\n        </intent-filter>\n    </receiver>\n</config-file>\n```\n\nPlease bear in mind that, if you are using your own broadcast receiver which handles the INSTALL_REFERRER intent, you don't need the Adjust broadcast receiver to be added to your manifest file. You can remove it, but inside your own receiver add the call to the Adjust broadcast receiver as described in our [Android guide][broadcast-receiver-custom].\n\n### <a id=\"ios-frameworks\">iOS frameworks\n\nAdjust SDK plugin adds three iOS frameworks to your generated Xcode project:\n\n* `iAd.framework` - in case you are running iAd campaigns.\n* `AdSupport.framework` - for reading iOS Advertising Id (IDFA).\n* `AdjustSdk.framework` - our native iOS SDK framework.\n\nSettings for this can also be found in `plugin.xml` file of the Adjust SDK plugin:\n\n```xml\n<framework src=\"src/iOS/AdjustSdk.framework\" custom=\"true\" />\n<framework src=\"AdSupport.framework\" weak=\"true\" />\n<framework src=\"iAd.framework\" weak=\"true\" />\n```\n\nIf you are not running any iAd campaigns, you can feel free to remove the `iAd.framework` dependency.\n\n## <a id=\"additional-features\">Additional features\n\nYou can take advantage of the following features once the Adjust SDK is integrated into your project.\n\n### <a id=\"event-tracking\">Event tracking\n\nYou can use Adjust to track all kinds of events. Let's say you want to track every tap on a button. Simply create a new event token in your [dashboard]. Let's say that event token is `abc123`. You can add the following line in your button’s click handler method to track the click:\n\n```js\nvar adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent(\"abc123\");\nAdjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);\n```\n\n### <a id=\"revenue-tracking\">Revenue tracking\n\nIf your users can generate revenue by tapping on advertisements or making In-App Purchases, then you can track those revenues with events. Let's say a tap is worth €0.01. You could track the revenue event like this:\n\n```js\nvar adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent(\"abc123\");\n\nadjustEvent.setRevenue(0.01, \"EUR\");\n\nAdjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);\n```\n\nWhen you set a currency token, Adjust will automatically convert the incoming revenues into a reporting revenue of your choice. Read more about [currency conversion here][currency-conversion].\n\n\n### <a id=\"revenue-deduplication\"></a>Revenue deduplication\n\nYou can also add an optional transaction ID to avoid tracking duplicate revenues. The last ten transaction IDs are remembered, and revenue events with duplicate transaction IDs are skipped. This is especially useful for In-App Purchase tracking. You can see an example below.\n\nIf you want to track in-app purchases, please make sure to call the `trackEvent` only if the transaction is finished and an item is purchased. That way you can avoid tracking revenue that is not actually being generated.\n\n```js\nvar adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent(\"abc123\");\n\nadjustEvent.setRevenue(0.01, \"EUR\");\nadjustEvent.setTransactionId(\"{YourTransactionId}\");\n\nAdjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);\n```\n\n**Note**: Transaction ID is the iOS term, unique identifier for successfully finished Android In-App-Purchases is named **Order ID**.\n\n### <a id=\"iap-verification\">In-App Purchase verification\n\nIf you want to verify your In-App Purchases, you can use Adjust's Purchase Verification product, our server side receipt verification tool. Check out our Cordova purchase SDK and read more about it [here][cordova-purchase-sdk].\n\n### <a id=\"callback-parameters\">Callback parameters\n\nYou can also register a callback URL for that event in your [dashboard][dashboard] and we will send a GET request to that URL whenever the event gets tracked. In that case you can also put some key-value pairs in an object and pass it to the `trackEvent` method. We will then append these named parameters to your callback URL.\n\nFor example, suppose you have registered the URL `http://www.adjust.com/callback` for your event with event token `abc123` and execute the following lines:\n\n```js\nvar adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent(\"abc123\");\n\nadjustEvent.addCallbackParameter(\"key\", \"value\");\nadjustEvent.addCallbackParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n\nAdjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);\n```\n\nIn that case we would track the event and send a request to:\n\n```\nhttp://www.adjust.com/callback?key=value&foo=bar\n```\n\nIt should be mentioned that we support a variety of placeholders like `{idfa}` for iOS or `{gps_adid}` for Android that can be used as parameter values.  In the resulting callback the `{idfa}` placeholder would be replaced with the ID for Advertisers of the current device for iOS and the `{gps_adid}` would be replaced with the Google Advertising ID of the current device for Android. Also note that we don't store any of your custom parameters, but only append them to your callbacks. If you haven't registered a callback for an event, these parameters won't even be read.\n\nYou can read more about using URL callbacks, including a full list of available values, in our [callbacks guide][callbacks-guide].\n\n### <a id=\"partner-parameters\">Partner parameters\n\nSimilarly to the callback parameters mentioned above, you can also add parameters that Adjust will transmit to the network partners of your choice. You can activate these networks in your Adjust dashboard.\n\nThis works similarly to the callback parameters mentioned above, but can be added by calling the `addPartnerParameter` method on your `AdjustEvent` instance.\n\n```js\nvar adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent(\"abc123\");\n\nadjustEvent.addPartnerParameter(\"key\", \"value\");\nadjustEvent.addPartnerParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n\nAdjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent);\n```\n\nYou can read more about special partners and networks in our [guide to special partners][special-partners].\n\n### <a id=\"session-parameters\">Session parameters\n\nSome parameters are saved to be sent in every event and session of the Adjust SDK. Once you have added any of these parameters, you don't need to add them every time, since they will be saved locally. If you add the same parameter twice, there will be no effect.\n\nThese session parameters can be called before the Adjust SDK is launched to make sure they are sent even on install. If you need to send them with an install, but can only obtain the needed values after launch, it's possible to [delay](#delay-start) the first launch of the Adjust SDK to allow this behaviour.\n\n### <a id=\"session-callback-parameters\"> Session callback parameters\n\nThe same callback parameters that are registered for [events](#callback-parameters) can be also saved to be sent in every event or session of the Adjust SDK.\n\nThe session callback parameters have a similar interface of the event callback parameters. Instead of adding the key and its value to an event, it's added through a call to method `addSessionCallbackParameter` of the `Adjust` instance:\n\n```js\nAdjust.addSessionCallbackParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n```\n\nThe session callback parameters will be merged with the callback parameters added to an event. The callback parameters added to an event have precedence over the session callback parameters. Meaning that, when adding a callback parameter to an event with the same key to one added from the session, the value that prevails is the callback parameter added to the event.\n\nIt's possible to remove a specific session callback parameter by passing the desiring key to the method `removeSessionCallbackParameter` of the `Adjust` instance:\n\n```js\nAdjust.removeSessionCallbackParameter(\"foo\");\n```\n\nIf you wish to remove all key and values from the session callback parameters, you can reset it with the method `resetSessionCallbackParameters` of the `Adjust` instance:\n\n```js\nAdjust.resetSessionCallbackParameters();\n```\n\n### <a id=\"session-partner-parameters\">Session partner parameters\n\nIn the same way that there are [session callback parameters](#session-callback-parameters) that are sent for every event or session of the Adjust SDK, there are also session partner parameters.\n\nThese will be transmitted to network partners, for the integrations that have been activated in your Adjust [dashboard].\n\nThe session partner parameters have a similar interface to the event partner parameters. Instead of adding the key and its value to an event, it's added through a call to method `addSessionPartnerParameter` of the `Adjust` instance:\n\n```js\nAdjust.addSessionPartnerParameter(\"foo\", \"bar\");\n```\n\nThe session partner parameters will be merged with the partner parameters added to an event. The partner parameters added to an event have precedence over the session partner parameters. Meaning that, when adding a partner parameter to an event with the same key to one added from the session, the value that prevails is the partner parameter added to the event.\n\nIt's possible to remove a specific session partner parameter by passing the desiring key to the method `removeSessionPartnerParameter` of the `Adjust` instance:\n\n```js\nAdjust.removeSessionPartnerParameter(\"foo\");\n```\n\nIf you wish to remove all keys and values from the session partner parameters, you can reset it with the method `resetSessionPartnerParameters` of the `Adjust` instance:\n\n```js\nAdjust.resetSessionPartnerParameters();\n```\n\n### <a id=\"delay-start\">Delay start\n\nDelaying the start of the Adjust SDK allows your app some time to obtain session parameters, such as unique identifiers, to be sent on install.\n\nSet the initial delay time in seconds with the `setDelayStart` field of the `AdjustConfig` instance:\n\n```js\nadjustConfig.setDelayStart(5.5);\n```\n\nIn this case this will make the Adjust SDK not send the initial install session and any event created for 5.5 seconds. After this time is expired or if you call `sendFirstPackages()` of the `Adjust` instance in the meanwhile, every session parameter will be added to the delayed install session and events and the Adjust SDK will resume as usual.\n\n**The maximum delay start time of the Adjust SDK is 10 seconds**.\n\n### <a id=\"attribution-callback\">Attribution callback\n\nYou can register a listener to be notified of tracker attribution changes. Due to the different sources considered for attribution, this information cannot by provided synchronously. The simplest way is to create a single anonymous listener which is going to be called **each time your user's attribution value changes**:\n\nWith the `AdjustConfig` instance, before starting the SDK, add the anonymous listener:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n\nadjustConfig.setAttributionCallbackListener(function(attribution) {\n    // Printing all attribution properties.\n    console.log(\"Attribution changed!\");\n    console.log(attribution.trackerToken);\n    console.log(attribution.trackerName);\n    console.log(attribution.network);\n    console.log(attribution.campaign);\n    console.log(attribution.adgroup);\n    console.log(attribution.creative);\n    console.log(attribution.clickLabel);\n    console.log(attribution.adid);\n});\n\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nWithin the listener function you have access to the `attribution` parameters. Here is a quick summary of its properties:\n\n- `trackerToken`    the tracker token of the current install.\n- `trackerName`     the tracker name of the current install.\n- `network`         the network grouping level of the current install.\n- `campaign`        the campaign grouping level of the current install.\n- `adgroup`         the ad group grouping level of the current install.\n- `creative`        the creative grouping level of the current install.\n- `clickLabel`      the click label of the current install.\n- `adid`            the Adjust device identifier.\n\nPlease make sure to consider our [applicable attribution data policies][attribution-data].\n\n### <a id=\"session-event-callbacks\">Session and event callbacks\n\nYou can register a callback to be notified of successful and failed tracked events and/or sessions.\n\nFollow the same steps as for attribution callback to implement the following callback function for successfully tracked events:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n\nadjustConfig.setEventTrackingSucceededCallbackListener(function(eventSuccess) {\n    // Printing all event success properties.\n    console.log(\"Event tracking succeeded!\");\n    console.log(eventSuccess.message);\n    console.log(eventSuccess.timestamp);\n    console.log(eventSuccess.eventToken);\n    console.log(eventSuccess.adid);\n    console.log(eventSuccess.jsonResponse);\n});\n\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nThe following callback function for failed tracked events:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n\nadjustConfig.setEventTrackingFailedCallbackListener(function(eventFailure) {\n    // Printing all event failure properties.\n    console.log(\"Event tracking failed!\");\n    console.log(eventFailure.message);\n    console.log(eventFailure.timestamp);\n    console.log(eventFailure.eventToken);\n    console.log(eventFailure.adid);\n    console.log(eventFailure.willRetry);\n    console.log(eventFailure.jsonResponse);\n});\n\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nFor successfully tracked sessions:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n\nadjustConfig.setSessionTrackingSucceededCallbackListener(function(sessionSuccess) {\n    // Printing all session success properties.\n    console.log(\"Session tracking succeeded!\");\n    console.log(sessionSuccess.message);\n    console.log(sessionSuccess.timestamp);\n    console.log(sessionSuccess.adid);\n    console.log(sessionSuccess.jsonResponse);\n});\n\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nAnd for failed tracked sessions:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n\nadjustConfig.setSessionTrackingFailedCallbackListener(function(sessionFailure) {\n    // Printing all session failure properties.\n    console.log(\"Session tracking failed!\");\n    console.log(sessionFailure.message);\n    console.log(sessionFailure.timestamp);\n    console.log(sessionFailure.adid);\n    console.log(sessionFailure.willRetry);\n    console.log(sessionFailure.jsonResponse);\n});\n\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nThe callback functions will be called after the SDK tries to send a package to the server. Within the callback you have access to a response data object specifically for the callback. Here is a quick summary of the session response data properties:\n\n- `var message` the message from the server or the error logged by the SDK.\n- `var timestamp` timestamp from the server.\n- `var adid` a unique device identifier provided by Adjust.\n- `var jsonResponse` the JSON object with the response from the server.\n\nBoth event response data objects contain:\n\n- `var eventToken` the event token, if the package tracked was an event.\n\nAnd both event and session failed objects also contain:\n\n- `var willRetry` indicates there will be an attempt to resend the package at a later time.\n\n### <a id=\"disable-tracking\">Disable tracking\n\nYou can disable the Adjust SDK from tracking by invoking the method `setEnabled` of the `Adjust` instance with the enabled parameter as `false`. This setting is **remembered between sessions**, but it can only be activated after the first session.\n\n```js\nAdjust.setEnabled(false);\n```\n\nYou can verify if the Adjust SDK is currently active with the method `isEnabled` of the `Adjust` instance. It is always possible to activate the Adjust SDK by invoking `setEnabled` with the parameter set to `true`.\n\n### <a id=\"offline-mode\">Offline mode\n\nYou can put the Adjust SDK in offline mode to suspend transmission to our servers while retaining tracked data to be sent later. When in offline mode, all information is saved in a file, so be careful not to trigger too many events while in offline mode.\n\nYou can activate offline mode by calling the method `setOfflineMode` of the `Adjust` instance with the parameter `true`.\n\n```js\nAdjust.setOfflineMode(true);\n```\n\nConversely, you can deactivate offline mode by calling `setOfflineMode` with `false`. When the Adjust SDK is put back in online mode, all saved information is send to our servers with the correct time information.\n\nUnlike disabling tracking, **this setting is not remembered** between sessions. This means that the SDK is in online mode whenever it is started, even if the app was terminated in offline mode.\n\n### <a id=\"event-buffering\">Event buffering\n\nIf your app makes heavy use of event tracking, you might want to delay some HTTP requests in order to send them in one batch every minute. You can enable event buffering with your `AdjustConfig` instance by calling `setEventBufferingEnabled` method:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n\nadjustConfig.setEventBufferingEnabled(true);\n\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\n### <a id=\"background-tracking\">Background tracking\n\nThe default behaviour of the Adjust SDK is to **pause sending HTTP requests while the app is in the background**. You can change this in your `AdjustConfig` instance by calling `setSendInBackground` method:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n\nadjustConfig.setSendInBackground(true);\n\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nIf nothing is set, sending in background is **disabled by default**.\n\n### <a id=\"device-ids\">Device IDs\n\nCertain services (such as Google Analytics) require you to coordinate Device and Client IDs in order to prevent duplicate reporting.\n\n### <a id=\"di-idfa\">iOS Advertising Identifier\n\nTo obtain the IDFA, call the `getIdfa` method of the `Adjust` instance. You need to pass a callback to that method in order to obtain the value:\n\n```js\nAdjust.getIdfa(function(idfa) {\n    // Use idfa value.\n});\n```\n\n\n### <a id=\"di-gps-adid\">Google Play Services advertising identifier\n\nIf you need to obtain the Google Advertising ID, you can call the `getGoogleAdId` method of the `Adjust` instance. You need to pass a callback to that method in order to obtain the value:\n\n```js\nAdjust.getGoogleAdId(function(googleAdId) {\n    // Use googleAdId value.\n});\n```\n\nInside the callback method you will have access to the Google Advertising ID as the variable `googleAdId`.\n\n### <a id=\"di-adid\"></a>Adjust device identifier\n\nFor every device with your app installed on it, the Adjust backend generates a unique **Adjust device identifier** (**adid**). In order to obtain this identifier, call the `getAdid` method of the `Adjust` instance. You need to pass a callback to that method in order to obtain the value:\n\n```js\nAdjust.getAdid(function(adid) {\n    // Use adid value.\n});\n```\n\n**Note**: Information about the **adid** is only available after an app installation has been tracked by the Adjust backend. From that moment on, the Adjust SDK has information about the device **adid** and you can access it with this method. So, **it is not possible** to access the **adid** value before the SDK has been initialised and installation of your app has been successfully tracked.\n\n### <a id=\"user-attribution\"></a>User attribution\n\nAs described in the [attribution callback section](#attribution-callback), this callback is triggered, providing you with information about a new attribution whenever it changes. If you want to access information about a user's current attribution whenever you need it, you can make a call to the `getAttribution` method of the `Adjust` instance:\n\n```js\nAdjust.getAttribution(function(attribution) {\n    // Use attribution object in same way like in attribution callback.\n});\n```\n\n**Note**: Information about current attribution is only available after an app installation has been tracked by the Adjust backend and the attribution callback has been triggered. From that moment on, the Adjust SDK has information about a user's attribution and you can access it with this method. So, **it is not possible** to access a user's attribution value before the SDK has been initialised and an attribution callback has been triggered.\n\n### <a id=\"push-token\">Push token\n\nTo send us the push notification token, add the following call to Adjust **whenever you get your token in the app or when it gets updated**:\n\n```js\nAdjust.setDeviceToken(\"YourPushNotificationToken\");\n```\n\n### <a id=\"pre-installed-trackers\">Pre-installed trackers\n\nIf you want to use the Adjust SDK to recognize users that found your app pre-installed on their device, follow these steps.\n\n1. Create a new tracker in your [dashboard].\n2. Open your app delegate and add set the default tracker of your `AdjustConfig` instance:\n\n    ```js\n    var adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n\n    adjustConfig.setDefaultTracker(\"{TrackerToken}\");\n    \n    Adjust.create(adjustConfig);\n    ```\n\n  Replace `{TrackerToken}` with the tracker token you created in step 2. Please note that the dashboard displays a tracker \n  URL (including `http://app.adjust.com/`). In your source code, you should specify only the six-character token and not the\n  entire URL.\n\n3. Build and run your app. You should see a line like the following in the app's log output:\n\n    ```\n    Default tracker: 'abc123'\n    ```\n\n### <a id=\"deeplinking\">Deep linking\n\nIf you are using the Adjust tracker URL with an option to deep link into your app from the URL, there is the possibility to get info about the deep link URL and its content. Hitting the URL can happen when the user has your app already installed (standard deep linking scenario) or if they don't have the app on their device (deferred deep linking scenario).\n\n### <a id=\"deeplinking-standard\">Standard deep linking scenario\n\nStandard deep linking scenario is a platform specific feature and in order to support it, you need to add some additional settings to your app. If your user already has the app installed and hits the tracker URL with deep link information in it, your application will be opened and the content of the deep link will be sent to your app so that you can parse it and decide what to do next. \n\n**Note for iOS**: With the introduction of iOS 9, Apple has changed the way deep linking is handled in the app. Depending on which scenario you want to use for your app (or if you want to use them both to support a wide range of devices), you need to set up your app to handle one or both of the following scenarios.\n\n### <a id=\"deeplinking-android-ios-old\"> Deep linking on Android & iOS 8 and earlier\n\nTo support deep linking handling in your app for Android and iOS 8 and earlier versions, you can use the `Custom URL Scheme` plugin which can be found [here][custom-url-scheme].\n\nAfter you successfully integrate this plugin, in the callback method used with the plugin described in this [section][custom-url-scheme-usage] you will have an access to the content of the URL which opened your app on user's device:\n\n```js\nfunction handleOpenURL(url) {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        // Check content of the url object and get information about the URL.\n    }, 300);\n};\n```\n\nBy completing integration of this plugin, you should be able to handle deep linking in **Android and iOS 8 and lower**.\n\n### <a id=\"deeplinking-ios-new\"> Deep linking on iOS 9 and later\n\nStarting from **iOS 9**, Apple has introduced suppressed support for old style deep linking with custom URL schemes like described above in favour of `universal links`. If you want to support deep linking in your app for iOS 9 and higher, you need to add support for universal links handling.\n\nFirst thing you need to do is to enable universal links for your app in the Adjust dashboard. Instructions on how to do that can be found in our native iOS SDK [README][enable-ulinks].\n\nAfter you have enabled universal links handling for your app in your dashboard, you need to add support for it in your app as well. You can achieve this by adding this [plugin][plugin-ulinks] to your cordova app. Please, read the README of this plugin, because it precisely describes what should be done in order to properly integrate it.\n\n**Note**: You can disregard any information in the README that states that you need to have a domain and website or you need to upload a file to the root of your domain. Adjust is taking care of this instead of you and you can skip these parts of the README. Also, you don't need to follow the instructions of this plugin for the Android platform, because deep linking in Android is still being handled with `Custom URL scheme` plugin.\n\nTo complete the integration of `Cordova Universal Links Plugin` after successfully enabling universal links for your app in the Adjust dashboard you must:\n\n### Edit your `config.xml` file\n\nYou need to add following entry to your `config.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<widget>\n    <universal-links>\n        <host name=\"[hash].adj.st\" scheme=\"https\" event=\"adjustDeepLinking\" />\n    </universal-links>\n</widget>\n```\n\nYou should replace the `[hash]` value with the value you generated on the Adjust dashboard. You can name the event also how ever you like.\n\n### Check `ul_web_hooks/ios/` content of the plugin\n\nGo to the `Cordova Universal Links Plugin` install directory in your app and check the `ul_web_hooks/ios/` folder content. In there, you should see a generated file with the name `[hash].ulink.adjust.com#apple-app-site-association`. The content of that file should look like this:\n\n```\n{\n  \"applinks\": {\n    \"apps\": [],\n    \"details\": [\n      {\n        \"appID\": \"<YOUR_TEAM_ID_FROM_MEMBER_CENTER>.com.adjust.examples\",\n        \"paths\": [\n          \"/ulink/*\"\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Integrate plugin to your `index.js` file\n\nAfter the `deviceready` event gets fired, you should subscribe to the event you have defined in your `config.xml` file, and define the callback method which gets fired once the event is triggered. Because you don't need this plugin to handle deep linking in Android, you can only need to subscribe to it if your app is running on an iOS device.\n\n```js\n// ...\n\nvar app = {\n    initialize: function() {\n        this.bindEvents();\n    },\n\n    bindEvents: function() {\n        document.addEventListener('deviceready', this.onDeviceReady, false);\n    },\n\n    onDeviceReady: function() {\n        if (device.platform == \"iOS\") {\n            universalLinks.subscribe('adjustDeepLinking', app.didLaunchAppFromLink);\n        }\n    },\n\n    didLaunchAppFromLink: function(eventData) {\n        // Check content of the eventData.url object and get information about the URL.\n    }\n}\n// ...\n```\n\nBy completing these steps, you have successfully added support for deep linking for iOS 9 and above as well.\n\n### <a id=\"deeplinking-deferred\">Deferred deep linking scenario\n\nWhile deferred deep linking is not supported out of the box on Android and iOS, our Adjust SDK makes it possible.\n \nIn order to get info about the URL content in a deferred deep linking scenario, you should set a callback method on the `AdjustConfig` object which will receive one parameter where the content of the URL will be delivered. You should set this method on the config object by calling the method `setDeeplinkCallbackListener`:\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n\nadjustConfig.setDeferredDeeplinkCallbackListener(function(deeplink) {\n    console.log(\"Deferred deep link URL content: \" + deeplink);\n});\n\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nIn deferred deep linking scenario, there is one additional setting which can be set on the `AdjustConfig` object. Once the Adjust SDK gets the deferred deep link info, we are offering you the possibility to choose whether our SDK should open this URL or not. You can choose to set this option by calling the `setShouldLaunchDeeplink` method on the config object:\n\n\n```js\nvar adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(appToken, environment);\n\nadjustConfig.setShouldLaunchDeeplink(true);\n// or adjustConfig.setShouldLaunchDeeplink(false);\n\nadjustConfig.setDeeplinkCallbackListener(function(deeplink) {\n    console.log(\"Deferred deep link URL content: \" + deeplink);\n});\n\nAdjust.create(adjustConfig);\n```\n\nIf nothing is set, **the Adjust SDK will always try to launch the URL by default**.\n\n### <a id=\"deeplinking-reattribution\">Reattribution via deep links\n\nAdjust enables you to run re-engagement campaigns by using deep links. For more information on this, please check our [official docs][reattribution-with-deeplinks].\n\nIf you are using this feature, in order for your user to be properly reattributed, you need to make one additional call to the Adjust SDK in your app.\n\nOnce you have received deep link content information in your app, add a call to `appWillOpenUrl` method of the `Adjust` instance. By making this call, the Adjust SDK will try to find if there is any new attribution info inside of the deep link and if any, it will be sent to the Adjust backend. If your user should be reattributed due to a click on the Adjust tracker URL with deep link content in it, you will see the [attribution callback](#attribution-callback) in your app being triggered with new attribution info for this user.\n\nIn the code examples described above, a call to the `appWillOpenUrl` method should be done like this:\n\n```js\nfunction handleOpenURL(url) {\n    setTimeout(function () {\n        // Check content of the url object and get information about the URL.\n        Adjust.appWillOpenUrl(url);\n    }, 300);\n};\n```\n\n```js\n// ...\n\nvar app = {\n    initialize: function() {\n        this.bindEvents();\n    },\n\n    bindEvents: function() {\n        document.addEventListener('deviceready', this.onDeviceReady, false);\n    },\n\n    onDeviceReady: function() {\n        if (device.platform == \"iOS\") {\n            universalLinks.subscribe('adjustDeepLinking', app.didLaunchAppFromLink);\n        }\n    },\n\n    didLaunchAppFromLink: function(eventData) {\n        // Check content of the eventData.url object and get information about the URL.\n        Adjust.appWillOpenUrl(eventData.url);\n    }\n}\n// ...\n```\n\n[dashboard]:    http://adjust.com\n[adjust.com]:   http://adjust.com\n\n[example]:      ./example\n[releases]:     https://github.com/adjust/cordova_sdk/releases\n[npm-repo]:     https://www.npmjs.com/package/com.adjust.sdk\n\n[google-ad-id]:         https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/id.html\n[enable-ulinks]:        https://github.com/adjust/ios_sdk#deeplinking-setup-new\n[plugin-ulinks]:        https://github.com/nordnet/cordova-universal-links-plugin\n[event-tracking]:       https://docs.adjust.com/en/event-tracking\n[callbacks-guide]:      https://docs.adjust.com/en/callbacks\n[attribution-data]:     https://github.com/adjust/sdks/blob/master/doc/attribution-data.md\n[special-partners]:     https://docs.adjust.com/en/special-partners\n[custom-url-scheme]:    https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Custom-URL-scheme\n[broadcast-receiver]:   https://github.com/adjust/android_sdk#sdk-broadcast-receiver\n\n[google-launch-modes]:    http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/activity-element.html#lmode\n[currency-conversion]:    https://docs.adjust.com/en/event-tracking/#tracking-purchases-in-different-currencies\n[cordova-purchase-sdk]:   https://github.com/adjust/cordova_purchase_sdk\n[google-play-services]:   http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/index.html\n\n[custom-url-scheme-usage]:      https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Custom-URL-scheme#3-usage\n[broadcast-receiver-custom]:    https://github.com/adjust/android_sdk/blob/master/doc/english/referrer.md\n[reattribution-with-deeplinks]: https://docs.adjust.com/en/deeplinking/#manually-appending-attribution-data-to-a-deep-link\n\n## <a id=\"license\">License\n\nThe Adjust SDK is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2017 Adjust GmbH, \nhttp://www.adjust.com\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies\nof the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do\nso, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
